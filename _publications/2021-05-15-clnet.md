title: "Composite Localization for Human Pose Estimation"
collection: pre-print
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for human pose estimation called composite localization to divide the complex learning objective into two simpler ones: a sparse heatmap to find the keypoint's approximate location and two short-distance offsetmaps to obtain its final precise coordinates.
