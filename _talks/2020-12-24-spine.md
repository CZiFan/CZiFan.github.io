We have won runner-up in the 2020 Spinal Disease Intelligent Diagnosis AI Challenge. This competition aims to intelligently locate and predict lumbar spine diseases based on deep learning. In this competition, we proposed CCF-Net, which can keep the model simple while maintaining potentiality performance and achieving faster inference speed and less computational cost. CCF-Net has been accepted by ISBI 2022. See [this link](https://czifan.github.io/publication/2022-03-16-ccfnet) for details.
