We have won second prize in the Zero-shot object detection of Zhijiang Cup Global Artificial Intelligence Competition (2021). This competition aims to train a model that can be used to detect the object of unknown categories in images with several novel images. Our solution consists of a class-independent object detector and deep metric learning based on bounding-box regions.
